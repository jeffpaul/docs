# Example site

Use this site to test the Docpress theme as you make changes. It's a simple metalsmith site; you can use `node metalsmith.js` or [metalsmith-start](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metalsmith-start).

Make sure to `rm -rf cache/` first, and restart metalsmith every time you change Stylus files.
