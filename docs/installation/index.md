# Installation

Setting up Tide locally is fairly straight forward and consists of the following steps:

1. Installing all the [prerequisite](prerequisites.md) software.
1. [Cloning](cloning.md) the Tide repository into your `$GOPATH`.
1. Finally. completing a handful of [setup](setup.md) steps in the form of `make` commands.

_If you run into issues while getting Tide installed, please contact us so we can address it and update the documentation for others._
