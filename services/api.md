# API

The Tide API is a Docker implementation of MySQL, PHP-FPM, and Nginx. The web server has WordPress installed with this documentation theme and a REST API for storing theme and plugin audits. If you plan on deploying to the cloud you should read the entire [Google Cloud Platform](../gcp/index.md) section.

_The API Docker containers must be up and running before you start any of the other services._

## Endpoints

The Tide API has several endpoints. I'll try and cover them in as much detail as possible. One important workflow to note when working with the API is that you must authenticate with the API and generate a token that you then use to make authenticated requests.

### `/api/tide/v1/auth`

Generates a user specific JSON Web Token (JWT) by making a basic authentication `POST` request with an API key and secret â€” which can be found on your user profile page.

#### `POST`

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `api_key` | Tide user's API key. |
| `api_secret` | Tide user's API secret. |

#### Usage

Request a JWT with your API key and secret:

```
curl -X POST \
    http://tide.local/api/tide/v1/auth \
    -F 'api_key=<api_key>' \
    -F 'api_secret=<api_secret>'
```

### `/api/tide/v1/audit`

This endpoint is used to get audit results and generate audits. There are several ways to generate an audit and reports. One of them is to make a `POST` request to the audit endpoint in the Tide API. An unauthenticated `GET` request option is describe lower on this page and is specifically for the `wporg` user. Another possibility would be to create a message in the queue, but that requires more access than a simple Bearer token.

#### `GET`

Request a collection of audits.

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `context` | Scope under which the request is made; determines fields present in response - `view | embed | edit`. Default is `view`. |
| `page` | Current page of the collection. |
| `per_page` | Maximum number of items to be returned in result set. Default is `10`. |
| `search` | Limit results to those matching a string. |
| `after` | Limit response to posts published after a given ISO8601 compliant date. |
| `author` | Limit result set to posts assigned to specific authors. |
| `author_exclude` | Ensure result set excludes posts assigned to specific authors. |
| `before` | Limit response to posts published before a given ISO8601 compliant date. |
| `exclude` | Ensure result set excludes specific IDs. |
| `include` | Limit result set to specific IDs. |
| `offset` | Offset the result set by a specific number of items. |
| `order` | Order sort attribute ascending or descending. |
| `orderby` | Sort collection by object attribute. |
| `slug` | Limit result set to posts with one or more specific slugs. |
| `status` | Limit result set to posts assigned one or more statuses. |
| `audit_project` | Limit result set to all items that have the specified term assigned in the audit_project taxonomy. |
| `audit_project_exclude` | Limit result set to all items except those that have the specified term assigned in the audit_project taxonomy. |

#### `POST`

Create an audit that generates various report standards for WordPress themes and plugins.

|:--- |:--- |
| `title` | Title of the plugin or theme. |
| `content` | Description of the plugin or theme. |

| `source_url` | The source to the `zip` file. _In the future we will support `git` repositories._ |
| `source_type` | This must be `zip`. _In the future we will support `git` repositories._ |
| `request_client` | The Tide API user login name. |
| `force` | Force a re-audit for existing audit reports. Must be one of: `true`, `false`. |
| `visibility` | Sets the visibility of an audit. Must be one of: `public` or `private`. |
